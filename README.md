~ Zipcode Range Resolver registers the zip codes based on range on a custom Tree. 
This process is done by traversing left and right based on the value of lowerRange. 
That is if input lowerRange is less than root lower range traversing is done on the left. 
If input lowerRange is greater than root lower range traversing id done on the right.
